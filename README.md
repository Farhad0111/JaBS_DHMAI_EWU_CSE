JaBS: Java Building Block Stairs
================================

“JaBS” is the compilation of Knowledge of Java. Java evolved from the features inherited from C and C++ and polished their features to improve the current demand of programming. This document is solely the property of East West University, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Dhaka, Bangladesh. 
 
About Java: 
===========

James Grosling (born 19 May 1955) is the Father of Java who stared the Project in early 90's. He is a Canadian Computer scientist, best known as the founder and lead designer behind the Java programming language. He got the idea for the Java VM while writing a program to port software from a PERQ by translating the hardware.
